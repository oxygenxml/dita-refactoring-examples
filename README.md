# dita-refactoring-examples
Examples of refactoring DITA content using XSLT stylesheets. The "restructure-dita.odp" presentation contains more information about the samples.

Oxygen allows you to apply these refactor XSLT stylesheets over multiple XML documents:
https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/custom-refactoring-operations-x-tools.html

In the Oxygen Preferences->**XML / XML Refactoring** page you can point to this project's entire folder and all the actions will be loaded from it.

Afterwards in the Oxygen main menu **Tools->XML Refactoring** dialog you can search for a certain action and apply it on one or multiple files.
